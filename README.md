# WalletConnectSharp-Fork
This repository contains a fork of WalletConnectSharp implementation required to combine its WalletConnect 2.0 protocol features with AnkrSDK repository. 

Initial content of this repo is coming from [this commit](https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectSharp/commit/b9265e866179e33b7b853f03c7fc79047f1cbb1f) of [WalletConnectSharp](https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectSharp) repo.

The core change we had to do in order to make DLLs built with this repo solution compatible with [Ankr Unity SDK](https://github.com/Ankr-network/game-unity-sdk) implementation is to remove WalletConnectSharp.Crypto project dependency on BouncyCastle.Cryptography nuget package in order to avoid duplicate classes compilation error since [Ankr Unity SDK](https://github.com/Ankr-network/game-unity-sdk) already contains BouncyCastle.Crypto DLL with a subset of classes contained in BouncyCastle.Cryptography. Instead of using BouncyCastle.Cryptography nuget dependency we created Imported folder in WalletConnectSharp2.Crypto project of this repo and moved all of the required classes from [BouncyCastle.Cryptography github repo](https://github.com/bcgit/bc-csharp) v2.0 release branch [commit](https://github.com/bcgit/bc-csharp/4f800b4d3229a011a8126d4aea698a3e14d0dd53) directly to Imported folder. We also had to rename several namespaces from WalletConnectSharp.* to WalletConnectSharp2.* to avoid duplicate class names.
